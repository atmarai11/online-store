# OnlineStore

OnlineStore displays all the products available in the home page. User can click on any of the product name or in the view detail button to see more detailed information about the product. Also, users can search for any particular product by their name by simply providing the name on the product in search input field.

## How to install

1. Clone the project `git clone https://github.com/ShivaAdhikari7/OnlineStore.git`.

2. Install all the dependencies `npm install` or `npm i`.

3. Run the project `npm start`.

After these steps, the localhost server on port 3000 will start - [localhost](http://localhost:3000).

## How to use

After [localhost](http://localhost:3000) is started by the React development server, it will land on the landing page which looks like:

In Landing Page there is a login button from where you can login to the application to view home page.

After that you will be directed to the home page where you can get the all products from the API.

Now, you can search for the product by navigating to the search page in the navigation bar. I have searched for shirt:

Also, you can view the details of certain product by clicking on the name or the view detail button in the bottom.
